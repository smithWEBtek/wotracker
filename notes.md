Each muscle area has activity options for working it.
Each set is counted by relevant metrics.

Do 3 sets on the chosen muscle group. 
- 1st set gets you going: 
    - If you can barely do 12 reps, lower the weight. 
- 2nd set challenges you. 
    - If you can do 25 easily, increase the weight. 
- 3rd set fails the muscle by the end.
    - Push your self to the failure point by 12-15 reps

Save each set as you finish
